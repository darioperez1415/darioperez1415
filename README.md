### Hello, I am Dario Perez

I am a dedicated lifelong learner and a technologist by profession, with a passion for continuous growth in the field of development. Outside of work, I am also a proud dog dad to a wonderful pug named Basil. My journey as a developer began at the Nashville Software School, and I am fully committed to enhancing my skills with each new technology I encounter. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at Meharry Medical College, further broadening my expertise in this dynamic field.
